# Fleet-Management-System

Worked with 'Cyberworks Robotics' on a Telepresence Remote Control System
Support Project to customize their AWS cloud-based fleet management system
for a fleet of autonomous vehicles operating at a US airport.
Programmed Fleet Task Report Pages for the system and collected/displayed
data from over 6 autonomous devices.
Linked the front-end and the back-end for the system and added functionalities
to analyze the data generated and to download the report as a PDF file.
